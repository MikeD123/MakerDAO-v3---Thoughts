Data driven suggestion/guidance for the following:
* Debt Ceiling (SCD & MCD).
* CDP ownership/accessibility.
* Stability Fee.
* Dai Savings Rate.
* Oracles & Pricing.
* Collater Pool.

Ambiguous sentiment orientated decisions:
* Exchange venues eligible for price discovery.
* Oracles integrity and transparency.
* Market maker incentives.
* Strategy to introduce new asset classes (native on-chain BTC vs tokenized property/securities)
* Newer assets to be introduced to the the system.

The further evolved a system becomes, the harder it is to make changes. Early decisions have ongoing effects. Imagine what the ecosystem would look like today if we saw Satoshi create irreversible digital currency and go push it weeks later on gambling and adult forums as a payment method. The shortsighted approach would'nt have given us the foundations we've got today. Similarly to MakerDAO being selective in MKR issuance, instead of spraying and praying. Tight foundations are absolutely necessary for a system over the long term.

Below are a series of calculations that I believe construct a more liquid, more scalable & predictable system. Removing the key variables that challenge the core value prop. Stability.

## CDP's
- 0 CDP's available in the system. To generate a CDP, a verifiable on-chain trade must be completed between the collateral and the stable asset. DAI/ETH trade.
- 1 CDP is able to be generated for every on-chain trade that is verifiable (e.g. a DAI/ETH trade on Uniswap).
- The person who completed the trade receives an ongoing decaying portion of the stability fee's paid on that specific CDP, or is paid a portion of the Dai savings rate paid out. Similar to a mortgage broker driving leads to a bank branch.
- Maker does a trade, system generates a new CDP that's eligible for use (of which the maker is the owner, but not necessarily the CDP holder) Bank (MakerDAO system) --> Mortgage Broker (the maker, capturing benefits from bringing the collateral to the CDP --> Home buyer (end user looking for leverage on-chain). 

# Q: Why would we not have infinite CDP creation?

A: Remember the scene in the big-short where they found the mortgage brokers who are farming out debt to anyone who will take it. While it's not an over-collateralized system like MakerDAO, it's similar in that the introduction of weaker hands or less-educated market participants can bring down the house. CDP accessibility is critical, but it is not critical today, it's critical long-term. When random bob citizen hears about this crypto thing going up and he buys in, he is more risk to the system than an OG long-term perma bull. To the hodlers reading this, you don't see blackswan events as bad, you see them as a chance to BTMFD (Buy the dip). Your hands are strong, and provide a stronger base to the system wide risk tolerance. More trades on-chain that are 100% verifiable means a healthier more aggressive trust-minimized price discovery mechanic. The stronger the rate is, the harder it is to enduce slippage relative to the liquidity of the system. So throttling CDP accessibility provides an incentive for on-chain broader distribution of price discovery instead of from a handful of trade teams. Healthier and stronger.

# Q: Why pay ongoing reward for these price-discovery/passive traders?

A: Two main reasons
    a) System-wide this carries much broader diversification of participation over TWAP over n blocks. Stronger price             integrity.

    b) Passive contribution *and* income to participants in other. While mitigating risk through price-discovery variation, it's passive adoption of DAI if they're being rewarded having not felt like they've done anything but perhaps buy a crypto-kittie with a debit card that went card --> fiat --> ETH --> DAI. Provides a stronger adoption for businesses/merchants/etc also... Startups like a Uniswap for example would be receiving all thisBuy some token on an exchange portal or something so passive. 

## Debt ceiling ##

The debt ceiling is for mitigating risk. Risk exists through poor price discovery relative to how large the system is. So we're going to compare the miner fees paid on eligible on-chain trades. The proportion of the total block-reward divided by the number of collateral types will help give guidance to the risk levels. 

Debt ceiling is calculated as follows:

**((F/Br)*C)/T**

F = gas fees paid in on chain price discovery.
Br = Block reward (total)
C = CDP count
T = # of collateral types.

Based on present day numbers (1 or two trades per block, 8900 CDPâ€™s and 1 collateral type).

Debt ceiling = 1.75% of Total ETH // Funnily enough, not far from the numbers today.

## Q: How do we increase the debt ceiling then?

   A: To increase the debt ceiling, complete more investment-chain trades to ensure fees are high proportion of the block reward.

## Q: Oracles just disappear? Surely not?
   A: No, they still are pushing their rates on chain, and they'll be utilized in the next section for determining the stability fee.
   
## Oracles Role ##

The issue that occurs with a select few oracles presently is that:

1) Largely a "security through obscurity" (not reveal who they are, which I understand the motivations, but hard to scale to a multi-trillion Dai float without ironing that out.)

2) Exchange selection is not verified or transparent. We all know that CMC is garbage, and only certain exchanges carry enough integrity to truly give an accurate price indication. To mitigate this, most trade venues evaluate this counter-party risk by hitting their books and discovering how much slippage there was. The less slippage, the more honest the numbers that are being claimed.

3) Multi-variant environments (. Exchange fee's on one platform, differ to another, and withdraw limits, regulations, etc... All wrap up into oracle pricing. Which is not entirely inaccurate, it's just misleading to a larger dataset that is relying on it. For comparison, it'd be like in 2017, the Kimchi premium 33% arbitrage between South Korea ETH price, and the USA ETH price. ** Additional context at the bottom for you.

## Q: So what do oracles do then?
   A: They're piping in the price, from *eligible* exchanges which have been voted in by MKR holders. 



## Stability fee ##

Relatively straight forward. We're going to find the gap between the two price feeds. On-chain price discovery of DAI/ETH and compare against USD/ETH price feeds from oracles.

D*Cp

D = Delta between on-chain price (as above) vs oracle pricing. Always Dai/collateralType va USD/collateralType.

Cp = Collateral pool. Could adjust this to a hard collateral ratio which would most naturally be 225%. 225% global pool is 1.5x of the local collateral requirements.

Current example
DAI/ETH = 143.24
USD/ETH = 138.85
Delta = -3.06%
Collateral pool = 321%

Stability fee is -9.84% based on these numbers. If preferring a fixed collateral pool size of 225% then it would be -6.89%.

## Q: What's the collateral pool got to do with it?
   A: The system is not supposed to be excessively collateralized, it's supposed to be over-collateralized to a certain point. Beyond that, it becomes dorment and passive participation in the CDP system, which is not efficient and overtime will become largely problematic. I'd suggest dividing collateral pool requirements for CDP's locally & then MKR systemically. CDP's are 1.5x, 1.5x system wide over collateralized gives the passive CDP participants motivation to get out of their unused CDP, and avoid fees etc... With finite amount of CDP's, people should be putting the CDP to work and then leaving the system.  

## Collateral Asset Category ##

Solving problems now, that are within the wheelhouse of expertise can be productized if they scale. This means that having the most on-chain verifiable oracles.
* Digitally native (ETH, REP, REN, ETC, BTC).
// Cryptographic recourse, 100% verifiable.

* Digital representation of non digital currencies (e.g. Fiatcoins, Digix, etc...).
// Partial cryptographic recourse, partial legal system.

* Digital representations of assets (Security tokens, property ownership put on chain, etc...
// Under-developed legal system that'll take time to get caught up. Resulting in more risk due to more ambiguity in the legal recourse procedures.

## Collateral Asset Selection ##

Some earlier thoughts on the premise of predictability of incoming collateral, trends, ceilings and volume. Provides the system the ability to forecast and plan accordingly.

** That's because of additional factors like capital restrictions which means if you get the money into the country, you're unable to send it back out. Great if you're offering a remittance service to South Korea, not optimal if you're trying to find the trade, execute, realize profit, reinvest, rinse/repeat. The capital outflows is your choke point so you aren't able to realize the arbitrage. Thus the premium stays for far longer than most would expect it to. Comparatively in the real world, USD to China is done as USD to CNH very frequently. Because the on-shore restrictions that exist in China (like South Korean example). So what they do, they typically don't compare CNH/CNY because it's largely not apples to apples. They compare USD/CNY to USD/CNH and try use that.
